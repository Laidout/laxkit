window overhaul:
----------------
----tasks:
loadable window configurations
window controls tied to variables


work out selecting for events, especially non-X events: man select(), use file descriptors??
  how to break out of select() from random threads?

work out details for a generic event filter,
	  which acts on events that have already been processed into EventData objects. This would
	  allow using the same mechanism for mouse gesture recognition AND for shortcuts, allowing
	  windows to respond only to basic events, rather that catching by redefining all
	  the input routines

work out rendering system independent of Xlib, see todo in laxutils.cc
  -> DONE :initX() would need to call function to init default graphics handling
  -> DONE anXApp::DefaultIcon() requires LaxImage? right now hardcoded to imlib
  -> DONE iron out something workable for fontdialog
  -> repair now broken text editor's dealing with fonts with missing glyphs

multiple device implementation:
  -> focus handling should be one focus per keyboard. fix in app->destroywindow()
       research _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW, rather than WM_TAKE_FOCUS... how does this work for MPX??
  -> Xim stuff per keyboard??
  -> implement device groups per user, rather than default keyb/mouse xlib grouping. Otherwise
       modifier determination is irrational
  -> debug multiscreen 

  -> DONE work out tooltip checking for multiple mice!!
  -> DONE (sort of) XDefineCursor() replacement? how to define cursors for any given window,
         potentially for each device: splitwindow, stackframe.. sort of works,but *** maybe transfer assigning
		 of pointer shapes to anXApp so as to preserve the const LaxDevice in mouse events?
  -> DONE pointer grabs?? such as for popups...
  -> DONE query mouse
  -> DONE  anXApp::setfocus(): XSetInputFocus() replacement?? do it in devicemanager?
  -> DONE-maybe  dialog event screening by device

DONE shortcuts
DONE really do anXWindow reference counting? if so, must revamp destroyqueued, destroykids, etc
DONE work out details of DeviceManager/LaxDevice/Xinput/Xinput2
DONE  how best to integrate XInput2? just assume to use it if available at compile time? yes
DONE  move key down processing from anXWindow to anXApp
DONE  work out and connecting owners to windows -> for now using just single owner, stored as object_id
DONE  remove dependence on non-Xft font things in LaxFont


-------------------------------NOTES-----------------------------

       UI
-------------------------------------
see ui.att


		DIALOGS
-------------------------------------
separate dialog_style from win_style in all dialogs? Sometimes too confusing otherwise!!


			EVENTS
-----------------------------------
other kits can connect functions to signals, so when
a window causes a signal to be sent, notification can be sent to 
one or more windows, not just to owner. this can be done for any
event.

Connect(ActionFunc, arg, eventype, eventCondition);
Connect(EventReceiver, arg, eventype, eventCondition);


custom event loops to accommodate threaded, and offshoot windows??

before mapping: _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE
determine extra wm decorations: _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS


----keyboards---
each window needs an xim_ic. with many keyboards, how does this work??
see anXApp::CreateXInputContext()




		CORE WINDOW ATTRIBUTES
---------------------------------------
NOT_DELETEABLE
GRAYED
REMEMBER
XDND_AWARE
CLICK/HOVER FOCUS
NO_INPUT
BARE
CENTER_ON_SCREEN (when initially mapped)
ESCAPABLE
FULLSCREEN

window icon/application class?
make sure wm-spec is satisfied
don't ignore multi screen environments

DONE (needs testing) ping protocol
DONE event propagation? (only for mouse and key events)



--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
-----------all below DONE-------------------
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------


			EVENTS
-----------------------------------
DONE need to do experiments with XInput to figure out how to get and relay events
DONE onButtonDown(which_button, modifiers, x, y, mouse_id)
DONE onButtonUp  (which_button, modifiers, x, y, mouse_id)
DONE onMouseMove (modifiers, x, y, mouse_id)
DONE Event(EventData *data)
DONE (in base classes anyway) combine DataEvent with ClientEvent, and abstract all events away from Xlib 
DONE figure out a sane way to do anXWindow/EventCatcher ref counting,
       so as to pave way for any object to receive events, such as interfaces..
DONE  Remove Atoms from anXWindow user parts. (done except for drag-n-drop)
DONE app->SendEvent(DataEvent*) define an internal file descriptor to select for?? otherwise background threads
	  sending generic events will not break out of Select...
	 -> using anXApp::bump() and multithreaded X


		DEFAULT PROPERTIES
-------------------------------------
---app properties:
1st click time to wait till repeat if holding down
double click
idleclick
tooltip time
tooltip fg color
tooltip bg color

---window properties:
bevel width
border width
inset padding
pw,s,g,align,fill,   ph,s,g,align,fill <-- these are assigned when needed by containers, they are not basic window properties

class WindowMetrics <-- NO, keep SquishyBox/metrics separate from basic window stuff
{
 public:
	int metrics[14]; //13 is flow penalty, 14 is line penalty for linebreaking hints, when to require rows together
	pw(), s(), g(), ...
};
class anXWindow : public anObject, public RefCounted
{
 public:
	WindowColors *win_colors;

	(irrelevant?) WindowMetrics *win_metrics;
	(irrelevant?) WindowFonts *normal, *text;
};

FONTS  --  unnecessary? probably
-----
normal font (menu, panel, etc)
text edit font
bold font?
italic font?


DONE: COLORS
------
inactive border color
active   border color

--foreach: panel, menu, edits, buttons
class WindowColors
{
 public:
};
fg
bg
hfg
hbg
mouse over fg (assume highlighted irrelevant)
mouse over bg
grayed fg
control pad color
