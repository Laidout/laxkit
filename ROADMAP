Laxkit Roadmap
--------------

What should be done to progress to the next version. Not final!


VERSION 0.0.9
-------------
       Re-re-fix cut-copy-paste
(done) CairoDisplayer, abstract the Displayer class to make swapping out backends easy
       FontDialog (which means working out fonts, big task!)
       Pop out multiple packages: liblaxkit(not yet, but I know how to now), liblaxkit-dev, liblaxkit-doc, laxinput
(done) have the integrated short-cuts/actions mechanism in place
(done) perhaps have the swappable graphics backend in place


VERSION 0.1
-----------
       multiple monitor support
       As appropriate, all controls must support multicontact, multipointer, and multikeyboard interfaces
         food for thought: touch devices with blob events: http://www.nuigroup.com
       By hook or by crook, handle left-to-right, right-to-left, and mixed text in controls
       Drag-n-drop more than just text, and with objects internally
       font management should be finally decided upon (harfbuzz, fribidi, libraqm?, freetype, fontconfig) and implemented
       Clean up patch controls
       lots of testing by other people (perhaps via laidout) 
       add descriptive pictures of the widgets and interface objects to the documentation
       some sort of basically useable color management should be in place, via lcms
       all planned core widgets must be at least slightly usable
          (see Lax Checklist in doxygen docs) this includes among other things:
         ColorSelector
         PrintDialog
         RailSlider (like a 'valuator'), could double as a 1-d scroller
         SliderInputPopup
       LaxInterfaces basics, meaning anInterface, InterfaceWithDp,
         ViewerWindow, and ViewportWindow should be more or less stable, and all 
         (almost done) current specific interfaces should work within that system correctly
       some sort of either test bed, example, or actual classes geared for opengl
